# umlang
A really simple Turing complete programming language.

Complete:
An interpreted runtime
A JIT-compiled runtime

In progress:
An assembler
A disassembler
A unit testing framework
An optimized JIT-compiled runtime based on LLVM

`runtimes/`:
interp: a UM interpreter
jit: a JIT compiler from UM binary to machine code
